Mod Description:
This mod modifies the Ankheg Plate Mail allowing to choose between two
options during install: "Plain Ankheg Armor" or "Ankheg Armor +1".

The former makes the Ankheg Plate Mail non magical, names it "Ankheg
Plate Mail", sets its AC to 2 (-1 vs. slashing, 1 vs. piercing and
missile) and do not prevent from equipping rings, cloaks or amulets
that provide a bonus to AC and Saving Throws.

The latter makes the Ankheg Plate Mail magical, renames it "Ankheg
Plate Mail +1", sets its AC to 1 (-2 vs. slashing, 0 vs. piercing
and missile) and prevents from equipping most rings, cloaks or
amulets that provide a bonus to AC and Saving Throws.


Installation instructions:
To install extract the files into the game directory, i.e. the one
containing the file chitin.key, and run setup-Nerfed_Ankheg_Armor.exe

To uninstall run again setup-Nerfed_Ankheg_Armor.exe

It is recommended to uninstall the mod before upgrading the game to
a new version, by applying an official patch, and reinstall after.
